 <p>Git stash is a way to store the changes you made on a branch without having to commit them or ad them too your project tht is being worked on.</p>
 <p>Its perfect for when youre in the middle of something and you want to switch to doing something else.</p>
 <p><strong>Hint:</strong> if you see the following output when changing branches, youmight want to consieer using git stash. "please commit commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches."</p>

 <p>To use Stash, simply run..</p>
 <code>Git stash</code>

 <p>You can view your stashed changes by runing <code>git stash list</code> This will show you a list of changes you have stored in the stash</p>
 <p>You can apply any given stash to whichever part of your project you like by running the following command:</p>
 <code>Git stash apply stash</code>. i = the number that corresponds to the stash you want to apply.</p>
